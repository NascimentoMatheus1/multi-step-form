# Objective
- an interactive web application using React that allows users to build a résumé (CV). Users should be able to input data into specific sections (General Information, Education, and Practical Experience) and submit the form to view the formatted CV. Additionally, the system must allow users to edit the information later, switching between the final document view and the pre-filled form fields.
